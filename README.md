# AlwaysResetLocalHome

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that forces the local home to be reset every time the game is launched, it also tries to load the local home file from `Resonite/RuntimeData/LocalModded.bin`.

The local home file is simply a renamed brson (or any other data tree file).

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [AlwaysResetLocalHome.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/AlwaysResetLocalHome/releases/latest/download/AlwaysResetLocalHome.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
